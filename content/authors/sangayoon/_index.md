<!-- 짧은 자기소개 -->
<!-- 연구분야/주제 관심사 소개 -->
<!-- 그 외의 것/trivia -->

I am Sanga Yoon, an undergraduate student at Korea University. I am majoring in Mathematics to fulfill my interest in AI. 

I am taking part of designing graphic elements and frontend UX in this lab.
My main field of study is visual communication design, especially specializing in type design.
As a would-be graphic designer, I always seek for a way to integrate AI and numerical analysis to type design workflow. 

Currently, I am designing a Hangeul typeface as well as participating in a type revival research team analyzing the early Hanguel metal types.
