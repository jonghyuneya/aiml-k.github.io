I'm Jeong-un Ha, a Ph.D. candidate in AIML-K. I majored in Representation Theory in the pure mathematics, but now I'm studying Generative Model and Neural Operator.

When I was in the project Noise Generation in our lab, I majorly dealt with the conditional/unconditional generative model synthesizing the seismic noise. After the project ended, I was involved in LSTM model development work and experiments sequential dataset synthesis in collaboration with the Department of Mechanical Engineering. (Not formal collaboration between labs.)

Now I'm interested in Neural Operator Learning. In particular, we focus on generative models using neural operator solvers. I believe that being able to synthesize datasets using mathematical theory will be very useful in environments where dataset synthesis is difficult.
