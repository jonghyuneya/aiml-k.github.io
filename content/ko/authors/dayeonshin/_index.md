<!-- 짧은 자기소개 -->
My name is Dayeon Shin, and I am a master’s student in the Department of Mathematics (MDS) at Korea University and researching artificial intelligence at AIML@K.

<!-- 연구분야/주제 관심사 소개 -->
My research interests include natural language processing (NLP). Additionally, I would like to explore AI applications in the environmental field, which is my academic background.

<!-- 그 외의 것/trivia -->
After graduating from Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, I worked as a math instructor for two and a half years, during which I realized my interest in mathematics. This led me to develop a keen interest in AI based on mathematical approaches, and I plan to conduct AI research utilizing various domains.
